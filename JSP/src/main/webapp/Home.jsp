  <p class="w3-opacity"><i>We love Nature</i></p>
  <p class="w3-justify">Visiting a hill station in the summers is the best getaway from the scorching heat of the city you live in. In addition to that, the pleasant weather and temperature are suitable for meditation and health restoration activities. 

India is a hot country with very high temperatures during April, May, and June. A short trip to a hill station every summer is exciting and quite tempting. Everybody wants to escape the blazing heat to refresh and rejuvenate. People who cannot afford to travel abroad are always keen to visit nearby hill stations to enjoy the summers. It is a great escapade for people, away from the high temperatures of the plains. 

Shimla has been on our wish list for a very long time now, it was locked as our destination this summer. My entire family was excited about this trip to Shimla. Our love for train journeys made us choose to travel by train for this trip. We boarded the train for Shimla early in the morning, and were going through these lush green lands, intriguing tunnels, and beautiful hillsides. 

We were simply mesmerized to see the view of many other hill stations like Solan, Jakej, Kumarhatti, etc. The next day we arrived at Shimla in the afternoon and took a cab to reach our hotel. Our room in the hotel was huge and had a breathtaking view. We got ourselves some rest and, in the evening, planned to go shopping and explore the Shimla market. 

The Ridge or Mall Road is the go-to place for the crowd to shop. Banks, classy hotels, coffee houses, and fancy shops were in high demand. The Ridge ends at the Mahatma Gandhi statue. We could also see snow-capped peaks by then, which melted our hearts.  

The next day we started with the Hanuman temple in the morning. We spotted many monkeys at the famous Hanuman temple, who were getting fed with bananas by the locals and tourists. We then started for Mashobra, an apple farm and horticulture center that is pretty well known. We received eye-opening information about horticulture there. Several misconceptions regarding the plants and flowers were cleared too. Lakkar Bazaar was the destination for the evening. It is a wood market, selling items made out of wood including walking sticks and decorative pieces. We returned to our room and rested after exhausting ourselves completely. 

The next morning, we had our breakfast and headed for Badi Ki Dhar. We witnessed the beautiful sights of Shimla from this hilltop. With cold winds brushing by our faces swiftly, the view was outstandingly mesmerizing. It also has a famous temple of Lord Shiva. The Lord is commemorated in an annual fair organized on the 14th and 15th of June. 

The next spot for us was the Switzerland of the East. It has this peculiar name to it since it’s covered with snow completely. It was all of our first time feeling and touching the real snow in its serene surroundings. We kept playing in the snow to our hearts were content. We ate a little bit and went back to sleep in our rooms. 

There were two more spots left to see in our itinerary. They were the Chadwick waterfall and the Himalayan Bird Park. The Himalayan Bird Park was best for bird watchers and nature lovers. We got to see very rare species of birds, some exotic pheasants, peacocks, and the Himalayan Monal. The amazing colours of the birds along with their chirping sounds made the atmosphere very vibrant. We even fed the birds with our own hands. The park is also famous for its collection of rare trees and plants. The last spot was the most-awaited place called the Chadwick waterfall. Located in an undisturbed corner of the Glen forests, the looming greens, the breezy climate, the sound, and the fragrance of the wild works as a mood lifter for the senses. 


Short Essay on a Visit to a Hill Station  
“A thing of beauty is a joy forever!” I was always told that hills are a thing of beauty. I had a chance to visit Shimla with my family. We took a train this time and the journey was quite thrilling for us. Shimla being a beautiful hill station, it was a wonderful experience for us. The very famous Mall road was hustling and bustling with the crowd. Literally a meeting place for all in Shimla. The lower mall is full of life. One could see the entire Shimla hills from the ridge, the widest, and the most beautiful spot. The pretty church on the ridge is a bonus attraction for any tourist. Shimla is named after Goddess Shyamalais known as the “queen of hills”. 


Additional Essays on Hill Station
Nainital  

The place got silent and serene as the night proceeded. Insects could be heard buzzing throughout. The calm water of the lake and the moon's reflection in it preserve the beauty of it at night.

We decided to go for a walk the next day to explore what the area has to offer. There were plenty of other lovely sights to view. A variety of birds and animals were seen. Some of them were stunning and one-of-a-kind. They appeared to be content walking through the forests and among the huge trees. The houses were uniquely designed and appeared to be unique. 

As we drove back with wonderful recollections of this site, our only concern was the steady deterioration of its unique beauty. Nainital is not only lovely, but it is also relatively pollution-free. The clean water of the lakes and the green, gleaming foliage of the trees were examples. However, with the flood of tourists, the natural beauty of this location is now being exploited for profit. Forest areas are being cleared to make way for hotels and shopping malls. 

For us, the trip to Nainital was a fantastic experience. Following our tour, we felt revitalised and energised. 

Mussoorie 

Around the 15th of May, Delhi's schools close for the summer holiday. It was really hot at that time. As a result, my parents decided to visit Mussoorie. The mere concept of travelling to the hills was exhilarating. The preparations were already underway. 

We prepared our belongings and prepared for the travel. We took the train to Dehradun. We travelled by automobile from Dehradun to Mussoorie. 

Mussoorie is one of India's hill stations. It's referred to as the "Queen of Hill Stations." It features a variety of lovely sports. We went to see the town the next day after breakfast. We went to the Landour and Library markets. They were all crammed with visitors from all across the country. 

We went for a walk after lunch along the Mall and Camel Back Road. We were enthralled by the vista all around us. The skating rink, which is a hotspot for fashion and colour, is worth a visit. We were able to see the Kempty Falls and the snow-capped mountain. 

We stayed in a lovely summer resort. The mountain slopes are covered in tall, green trees that make for a lovely sunset vista and a spectacular appearance. The hours of the morning and evening are also very lovely. It takes one's mind off the sweltering heat of the plains. 

A cold breeze refreshes the mind. Being so close to Mother Nature made me joyful. My heart was filled with excitement as I saw the vivid multi-coloured flowers, the clouds soaring through the sky, and the snow-covered peaks of the high mountains in the distance. 

We stayed for a fortnight there. I unwillingly returned to Delhi. My vacation to Mussoorie remains a vivid memory in my mind. 

Ooty  

We booked a car as soon as we arrived to contact our hotel. We stayed at the hotel for the night. We awoke early and went to the hotel restaurant for breakfast the next day before beginning our adventure. Breakfast was delicious, especially the coffee and dosa. The Government Botanical Garden near Coimbatore was the first location we went to. 

The Garden is separated into numerous areas, each with a different flower in bloom, and it appears to be a great place for photography. Then we travelled to the Ooty Boathouse in the Nilgiris, which provides tourists with boating opportunities. While boating, we were treated to breathtaking scenery. 

After we finished our meal, we went to see the famed Rose Garden, which has over 20,000 different varieties of roses. We went back to the motel and slept the night away. On our final day in Ooty, we went to the tea museum and factory, where they make high-quality tea and Toda cottages created by the Toda tribal people. 

The shelter's distinguishing feature is that it lacks windows and is quite low in height.   

It is one of Ooty's indigenous tribes that is reliant on agriculture. These are some of the places we visited during our brief stay, but there are many more that we plan to visit next year. The view and the weather it provided fascinated us all. 


Summary 
It was time for our journey back and it was by bus. It was captivating as the stars, the nightlife, the music, and the far-stretching hills were alluring us to revisit the place. The zig-zag roads gave us an opportunity to view nature from different angles. Shimla stands true to its tag of “queen of hills”. We would all love to come here again to find out the unexplored spots.
